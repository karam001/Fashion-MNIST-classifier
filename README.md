This project aims to highlight the phenomenon of **overfitting** and explore methods to address this issue. 

The focus is on classifying data from the **Fashion-MNIST dataset**, which comprises images of various clothing items. 

Initially, a model is created, trained and tested on this dataset, leading to the occurrence of overfitting. 

To mitigate this, regularization techniques are employed (L2 regularisation, dropOut, Data Augmentation and Batch Normalisation), and the process is repeated to achieve improved results.
